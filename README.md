## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! I'm Kent!

I'm a student developer currently studying BS Computer Science at the University of the Philippines Cebu.

I do programming for fun. On my free time, I usually play computer games with my friends. When I'm not playing, I devote myself on exploring, learning, and creating awesome stuff with technology.

I'm also a core member of DSC UP Cebu. In the future, I aspire to be a software developer.
